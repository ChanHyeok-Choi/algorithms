6. (2 points) Given an array A consisting of n positive integers, let's assume that we want to find a
positive integer k such that the total sum of the distances between all elements of A and k
becomes minimized, i.e., sum = min ∑ d_i from i=1 to n , where d_i = |A[i] - k| is the distance between A[i] and
k. Write real code (not pseudocode) that returns sum (not k), given an array A of length n. Write
(type) your code with a keyboard and upload it as a separate file.
● Your code should be written either in C or Python. It should be compiled and run (Zero points if
the uploaded code does not run).
● Do not use built-in C or Python libraries that directly solve the problem.
● Upload your code as a separate file
● Only the code uploaded to BlackBoard will be graded (not the code on your computer).
